# The Legend of MonoMax

Welcome to the repository of 'The Legend of MonoMax'. This project is a narrative-driven, interactive web experience that explores monolithic content management systems like Statamic.

## Content

'The Legend of MonoMax' is a story of transformation, where the protagonist - MonoMax, a representation of a traditional monolithic CMS - goes through a process of change to become ModuMax. The story seeks to delve into the pros and cons of both traditional and headless CMS, encouraging users to ponder upon the potential and the adaptability of CMS technology.

## Background

This project has been created using various tools and resources:

1. **Music**: The background score is handmade and produced by the author with Ableton Live heavily using this [8bit Live Pack](https://brianfunk.gumroad.com/l/8bit). The swing parts (chapters 7 + 8) were co-composed by Andreas Bohl. The music is not licensed under MIT, all rights are reserved.

2. **Images**: The visuals for the experience were created using MidJourney and were further optimized using various tools, especially [PixelIt](https://giventofly.github.io/pixelit/).

3. **Website**: As I'm the only one working on this project, I decided to use (ironically not use a CMS but) [Astro](https://astro.build) to create a simple, static website. (Statamic can create static websites, too!)

4. **Text and Code**: All the text and code for this project were co-authored by the project's creator and A.I.
