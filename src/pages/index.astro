          Welcome to the digital realm of CMS superheroes! Join an adventure
          where MonoMax, a modern but monolithic CMS like e.g. <a
            class='underline underline-offset-2'
            href='https://statamic.com'>Statamic</a
          >, faces the challenge of a new era. You'll guide MonoMax through a
          journey of transformation as we explore the tug of war between
          traditional CMS powers and the rise of Headless Heroes.
        </p><p>
          It's more than a tech tale; it's a quest about adaptability and the
          evolution of digital content management. Gear up for an epic ride!

      </Chapter>
      <Chapter title='I. The Power Paradox' chapter={1}>
        <p>
          In a vibrant pixelated city, MonoMax soars through the sky, his cape
          billowing behind him. He is the all-powerful superhero who can handle
          any web content challenge with his wide array of monolithic CMS
          abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lately, however, whispers of the new generation of superheroes, the
          HeadlessHeroes, have reached his ears. They speak of increased
          flexibility and adaptability, leaving MonoMax feeling overwhelmed by
          the sheer weight of his powers.

        <p>
          One day, after foiling a nefarious plot, MonoMax finds himself perched
          on a rooftop, contemplating his future. The city's lights twinkle
          below him as he ponders the possibility of shedding some of his
          powers, starting with his form handling abilities. As he gazes out at
          the city he has sworn to protect, he wonders what reasons could
          justify his decision.

        <p>
          With a sigh of relief, MonoMax carries the Enigmatic Envelope
          containing a piece of code representing his form handling powers to a
          hidden library filled with ancient servers and futuristic holographic
          displays. Placing the envelope in a specific slot in the library's
          central computer terminal, his ability to create and process forms is
          disabled.
        </p>
        <p>
          As he embraces his newfound freedom, a new superhero emerges from the
          shadows: FormMaster. Agile and specialized, FormMaster takes on the
          responsibility of form handling, ensuring that every submission is
          processed with precision and finesse. Now, MonoMax sets his sights on
          his search powers, ready to let go of yet another ability.

          MonoMax makes his way to a hidden cave where the legendary Search
          Stones are stored. He carefully places the stone containing his search
          powers, exposing it to the cave's shimmering crystalline light. As the
          symbols on the stone start to fade, his search abilities are lost.
        </p>
        <p>
          With his burden lifted, a new superhero, SearchSorceress, emerges from
          the shadows. Swift and specialized, SearchSorceress harnesses the
          power of search algorithms, delivering accurate results with speed and
          efficiency. Having relinquished two of his powers, MonoMax
          contemplates his next move: to let go of his assets saving ability.

          MonoMax journeys to the Cryptic Cloud, a mystical realm hidden within
          the swirling mists of cyberspace. He carries the Asset Amulet, a relic
          that holds the essence of his assets saving power. As he places the
          amulet on a pedestal surrounded by hovering data crystals, his assets
          saving ability is suspended.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the swirling mists, a new superhero emerges: AssetAce, an expert
          in managing digital assets with unparalleled efficiency. With three
          powers now shared among specialized superheroes, MonoMax ponders his
          next challenge: relinquishing his ability to create templates.

          MonoMax ventures to the Temple of Templates, an ancient structure
          hidden deep within the canyons of the digital landscape. In his hands,
          he holds the Chalice of Creativity, a vessel that contains the essence
          of his templating powers. As he pours the contents of the chalice into
          a glowing pool of liquid code, his templating abilities are released.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the shimmering pool, a legion of Template Titans arises, each a
          master of their own frontend domain. Giving up his templating powers,
          MonoMax realises that he now has to find other ways to have the power
          of frontend authentication.

        <p>
          At the point where MonoMax chose his future protocol, a mission comes
          his way: building a secure eLearning platform with personalized
          content for each user. This task would have been a breeze for MonoMax,
          but now, he finds himself overwhelmed. He needs to coordinate with a
          multitude of specialized superheroes to ensure seamless integration of
          authentication, content management, and so on. MonoMax wonders how to
          handle this mission.
        </p>
      </Chapter>
      <Chapter title='VIII: The Chaos of Collaboration' chapter={8}>
        <p>
          As MonoMax attempts to bring the specialized superheroes together, he
          quickly realizes that coordinating their efforts is far from easy. The
          team struggles to find harmony, with each superhero's unique powers
          and responsibilities clashing with one another. Miscommunication,
          conflicting priorities, and the lack of a central command structure
          create a chaotic environment, echoing the challenges faced by headless
          web projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          The once-simple eLearning platform mission becomes a complex
          undertaking, with the superheroes inadvertently creating more issues
          than they're solving. Their individual strengths fail to synergize,
          and the team's progress grinds to a halt. Frustration mounts as the
          once-mighty MonoMax realizes that his decision to let go of his powers
          has led to an even greater challenge: taming the chaos born from the
          collaboration of so many specialized heroes.
        </p>
      </Chapter>
      <Chapter title='IX: The Metamorphosis of MonoMax' chapter={9}>
        <p>
          A sudden epiphany strikes him like a bolt of lightning. He realizes
          that he can reclaim his powers and still work with his specialized
          allies whenever needed. With newfound clarity and determination,
          MonoMax understands that his true potential lies in his ability to be
          both monolithic and modular, adapting to any mission's requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a spectacular moment of self-realization, MonoMax transforms into
          ModuMax, a powerful superhero who can harness the best of both worlds.
          Embracing her new identity, she tackles the eLearning platform mission
          with ease, deftly using her restored powers while remaining open to
          calling upon her specialized allies when necessary.
        </p>
      </Chapter>
      <Chapter title='X: The Triumphant Transformation' chapter={10}>
        <p>
          As word of ModuMax's incredible versatility spreads, she becomes an
          even more important superhero than before, celebrated for her ability
          to adapt and collaborate. The people of the city rejoice, knowing that
          they have a hero who can face any challenge, embodying the perfect
          balance between the strengths of monolithic and headless CMSs.
